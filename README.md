About
=======

Heya, this is a school project thing so its fully for fun and unofficial

This is an unofficial remake/revamp of Akatsuki Records website 
The real website can be found here http://akatsuki-records.com/about.html

Note that theres some pages that are empty (about.html, contact.html and works.html)

Theres also a lot of albums and whatver that I left out for the sake of simplicity and my sanity

Also the a js file called youtube.js, i originally wanted to use the youtube api to fetch the data from the channel instead of hardcoding the videos in, however it the api has a quota limit which i easily hit during testing so i decided to hard code it lol
